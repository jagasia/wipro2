Method Overloading
Method Overriding
	what is the difference between these 2?

Method overloading
	same method name but different signature.
	both methods are in same class.


class Parent{
	public void method()
	{
		System.out.println("Parent method");
	}
}
class Child extends Parent
{
	public void method()	//overriding
	{
		System.out.println("Child method");
	}
	public void method(int i)	//overloading
	{
		System.out.println("child method with arg");
	}
}
public class App {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Child c=new Child();
		c.method();
	}

}
--------------------
i HAVE given the rules of 
overloading
overriding
in yesterday's notes.

-----------------------
There are many classes.
a class has data and methods
how we control the access of these members of the class.

How default access specifier works?

class Employee
{
	String department
}

department is having default access.	
what is meant by default access?
	no access specifier
	and it is accessible from any class inside same package.

so far, we created classes inside default package.
lets create packages now.

What is a package?
	package is a group of classes and interfaces.

Every class is stored in a file.
Every package is a folder.
java.util is a package
then there is a folder called java
and the util is a sub folder inside java folder.

for every package, there will be a folder
like a folder can contain subfolders, 
a package can contain sub packages.

in eclipse, it is easy to create packages.

package name follows the convention:	
	first portion is either com / org
		company means 	com
		organisation means	org
	second portion is the name of the company/ organisation
	third portion is the project name
	fourth portion is the role of the package
		model
		view
		controller
		service
		repository
		controller
		entity
	

	com.wipro.hrms

We can create a package using
	File -> New -> Package
and then add classes inside the package.
or

While creating a class itself we can mention the package name.
or

After creating a class, we can introduce package also.
	type
		package com.wipro.hrms;

and right click the error, move Employee.java to com.wipro.hrms package

----------------------------
You need to experiment by creating multiple packages
and check the access of each member of a class.

package com.wipro.hrms;

import com.wipro.hrms.entity.Employee;

public class ContractEmployee extends Employee 
{
	public static void main(String []args)
	{
		Employee emp=new Employee();
		emp.id=1;			//public
//		emp.name="Raja";	//protected	can be accessed from subclass
//		emp.department="IT";//default	only accessible in same package
//		emp.dateOfBirth=new Date();		//NOT accessible (private)
		ContractEmployee ce=new ContractEmployee();
		ce.name="Siva";	//protected		sub class of any package
		ce.id=222;		//public
		ce.department="ECE";	//default 	so not available in different package
		
				
	}
}



Packages not only organize the code.
They decide the access level of members of a class.

in command prompt:
how packages are created.
	because, every package refers to a folder.
	the compiled class will be inside the folder (of package name).


if i compile a java program with package declaration in cmd prompt??????????
	what should we do?	to create the folder and keep class files inside that folder.


package com.upskillit.hrms.entity;
public class College
{
}

when i compile this program, i will use 
	-d switch to create directory automatically in specified location
	
javac -d . College.java

what is a property of a class.
	any non-public data member, with public getter or setter or both is a property.

	if only setter is there, it is a write-only property
	if only getter is there, it is read-only property
	if both are there, it is read, write property
	if both are not there, it is not a property

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Java Collections Framework and Generics
Arrays: Declaration, Initialization, and Usage

Limitations of array
that leads to inventing new collections

Collections have advantages over arrays.
	i) we do not know the size of the collection when we create them.
		array needs to know the size when it is created
	ii) different type of collection and each have their own advantages.

Collections can be created on Reference type only.
Wrapper classes or any type BUT NOT PRIMITIVE TYPES

List interface.		java.util package
	this interface is implemented by lot of classes
		ArrayList
		LinkedList
		Vector		(legacy class, means, old)	it is synchronized.

Set interface		java.util package
		HashSet
		TreeSet
		LinkedHashSet

Map	is an application of collection.		Map is not collection.
Map interface
		HashMap
		TreeMap
		LinkedHashMap


List
	allows duplicates
	is ordered
	have index.	so we can have direct access to an element using its index
	We can use Collections.sort() to sort a list

Set
	rejects duplicates. If we try to enter an element which is already present, then that attempt is rejected.
	Order of Set is based on the type of the Set.
		HashSet		order is based on hashCode and equals method
		TreeSet		order is based on Comparable/ Comparator		is sorted.
		LinkedHashSet	order is based on the order in which the elements are added. 	Similar to List

Map
	is 2 dimensional data structure, which has
		Key - Value pair

	Key is a set.		Means, Set
		Key must be unique.
		If duplicate key is found while putting an entry to the Map, then its value is updated.
		Map does not reject duplicate key. It updates value when the key is duplicate
		Map allows one entry where key is null.		Another entry with null key is considered duplicate and update the value.

Iterator
	is used to traverse/ visit every element of the List/ Set
	is forward only 		
	has only 3 methods
		hasNext()		returns true, if any more element is available to iterate
		next()		returns next element
		remove()		removes the current element
ListIterator
	is used only with List type of collections
	we can move forward/ backward using ListIterator.	
	has additonal methods (apart from those 3 of Iterator)
		hasPrevious()	returns true if any more element is available to iteratore
		previous()		returns the previous element

	List<Integer> marks=new ArrayList<>();
		//left side of the declaration is List interface
		//right side of the declaration is implementation of List interface


import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class App {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		List<Integer> marks=new ArrayList<>();
		marks.add(20);
		marks.add(50);
		marks.add(15);
		marks.add(60);
		marks.add(35);
		marks.add(40);
		System.out.println(marks);
	}

}


[20, 50, 15, 60, 35, 40]


This proves that a List is ordered.
Order is not ascending or descending order. It is the order in which the elements are added to the list.

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class App2 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(34,21,26,54,38,76,90,89);
		Collections.sort(list);
		System.out.println(list);
	}
}

[21, 26, 34, 38, 54, 76, 89, 90]


NOTE:
	Collections.sort() does not work on Set or Map.
	It works only on List.



TreeSet is sorted.
But you cannot use Collections.sort()
This means, while adding elements to a TreeSet, the element is not always added at the end.
	It is added in such a way, it is sorted.
TreeSet does not allow altering the order later.

List is ordered in the same way as added, means, it is adding elements at the end.
	Later, we can sort list using Collections.sort()

Some common methods found in most of the collections:
	add()
	add(index, object);
	addAll()
	contains()		boolean
	remove(int)		remove at index
		ex:
			marks.remove(1);			//1 is primitive int, so it is considered as index
	remove(obj)		remove that element
		ex:
			marks.remove(new Integer(1));		//new Integer(1) is object so it is considered as element


How do you find an item from a list?
	ArrayList<Integer> means,
		contains method will return

	ArrayList<College> means,
		i) you may loop the collection and check if each college has the specific value or not
		ii) override the equals method of College to check specific values match means equal
			then create a College object with that specific value and use "contains" method
