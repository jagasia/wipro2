I got git credentials for trainer.
You all also got the git credentials.

1) from local system, (you have done some assignments), 
	how to move them to cloud lab.
2) from cloud lab (only the git credentials they provided will work)	GitLab
	we need to use the git credentials and push the assignments to the official gitlab

	from cloud to gitlab
		we use official git lab credentials

Challeng 1:
	moving my files from local system to cloud lab:

https://cloud2.rpsconsulting.in/console/#/

i have logged into cloud lab, using TR credentials.

From local machine to Cloud lab
	create a github repository
	upload your files to this github

Those who do not have git hub credentials
	i) you signup to github.com free and login
	ii) if you are comfortable with google drive, then
		create a folder in google drive and download them in cloud lab.

	

using github to upload files from local system to github
i) login to github.com
ii) create a repository
	click the + button "New Repository"
	i have created a repository "vemula"
iii) click the hyperlink "upload an existing file"
iv) click "choose your files"
	only 25 mb is allowed per attachment
	do it one by one if the file size together is > 25 mb
	click commit changes
v) continue to add files using
	Add file button
		upload files

in this way, you can upload lot of files one by one or together




package com.math.operations;



in cloud lab:
	c:\users\Administrator
		create a "Training" folder
			inside that "Assignments" folder
				"PCAT"
				"Java"

---------------------------------------------------------------------
RPS have provided you all with separate
	gitlab credentials

GitLab
	is an enterprise Git portal.

	you should login to GitLab using
		emailId		(provided by RPS)	username for gitlab
		password

After logging in to gitlab
	you have to create a repository		"assignment"

	gitlab.com/rpsemail/reponame
	gitlab.com/rpsemail/assignment

	gitlab.com/b55user01/assignment
