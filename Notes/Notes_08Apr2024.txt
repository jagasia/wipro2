-------------------------------------------------
Providing solutions using computers:
	i) data structures
	ii) algorithms

simple computation
	i) adding 2 numbers
	ii) rocket science

always there will be data and algo

2+3
	data 	2 and 3
	algo	addition


class Employee
{
	int id;
	String name;

	public void setId(int id)
	{
		this.id=id;
	}
}	

a class contains?
	data		(datastructure)
	methods		(algo)


Perfect combination of algo & ds will sovle the problem effectively.

If you want to apply binary search, then
the data should be in which form?
	Sorted
	Ascending/ Descending

conclusion:
	you cannot apply binary search algorithm on any datastructure but sorted one.

Array
	i can use index to find an element at any location of the array.

Binary Tree		in order, pre order, post order	
	how can i find an element at specific index?		NOT possible

ANY Alogirthm cannot work with ANY datastructure.
a perfect combination is important.

Before writing a code, 
we write
	algorithms
we draw
	flowcharts
we write
	pseudo code

These approaches are language neutral.

suppose, when a team leader want to share the logic to the team.
the team may be sometimes, dotnet team, js team, or java team.

Irrespective of whichever team, this leader is leading, still can communicate the logic to the team in a neutral way.


Programming Constructs			
Algorithms and Problem-Solving			

we can dry run any of these.

Introduction to Programming Constructs			
	VARIABLES
	CONSTANTS
	DECLARATION
	EXPRESSIONS
	STATEMENTS
	SEQUENCE
	OUTPUT
	GOTO
	IF
	IF ELSE
	IF ELSEIF ELSE			in PL/SQL		ELSIF
	NESTED IF
	SWITCH
	WHILE
	DO WHILE
	FOR
	BREAK
	EXIT
	CONTINUE
	SUBROUTINES/	FUNCTIONS

There are 2 things in a program
	declarations
	executable code
		any code written inside a function/method are executable code


class App
{
	//anything outside a method is not executable section, but DECLARATION is allowed
	int i=0;
	float f=1.2f;

		System.out.println("Hello world");	//NOT ALLOWED

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		i=20*30;
		System.out.println("Hello world");
		//is executable section
	}	
}

in python it is elif

X="Raja"
X*2		"RajaRaja"

Pseudo code:
------------------
	is a language closer to English so that anybody can understand.
	It is not meant to execute. But there are some pesudo code compilers now a days to execute pseudo code.
	But you have to follow the keywords and symbols mentioned by those compilers.

How pseudo code differs from algorithm?
	Algorithms does not have any keywords.
	It can be written in any language, preferrably English.
	It does not have any rules.
