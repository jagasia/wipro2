-----------------------------
What is Java?
	During 1990s, when c++ was in prime, a team in Sun Microsystems wanted to develop a new language, based on C, C++ and address the issues which were found in those 2 languages.
They used almost the same syntax of C, C++
some of the issues in those languages:
	not Platform Independent
	Pointer
	Memory Leaks
	Multiple Inheritance
	no Garbage collection
	and so on

They named it as Oak	(name of a tree)
then changed to Java		(name of coffee)

logo of java looks like a cup of coffee.
	

Java
	as a technology
	as a platform		
	as a language

we learn java as a language.

since this is a high level language (close to human)

we need a translater that converts/ translates java language to machine language.

when we discuss about compilation in java.

C, C++ were not platform independent.	(means, when i compile a c program in 16 bit machine, i cannot run it in 32 bit machine).

what happens when we compile a c / c++ program?
	c language code is translated into machine language code.	(binary)
	the problem is machine language is different for different type of machines.
	when i say machine, i mean microprocessor (which is inside the CPU).
	 µp can be 16 bit, 32 bit 64 bit and hence the operating systems now a days 64 bit
	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor

	binary / machine language is different

what is the ascii value of A
	A	=	65
	
when i say A in C lanugage, how it is translated into machine language

	A	=	0100 0001				8 bit
			0000 0000 0100 0001			16 bit
			0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0100 0001	32 bit

AB		=	0100 0001 0100 0010
			0000 0000 0100 0001 0000 0000 0100 0010

If i read information in 8 bit, it is different from how i read in 16 bit

i write in 16 bit
and i read in 32 bit	then it is found corrupted

a program compiled in 32 bit machine
cannot be executed in 64 bit machine

turbo C
gcc

in windows, C language supports conio.h	which is not supported in linux

C, C++ languages itself different for different platforms.

How can we address this issue?
	we want to compile java program only once, but it should run in different platforms without any issue.
	how?
	

Does java run in any platform?
	No
	Wherever JVM is there, it will run.
	Can anyone tell me, what are the platforms that support executing java?
		Linux		(android, Ubuntu, RedHat, etc)
		MacOS
		Windows

For a layman, Byte code and machine language are same.

The compilation process in java, is split into 2 stages.

Java -> English	(intermediate language)

English -> Telugu
English -> Tamil
English -> Hindi
Kannada
Malayalam

Stage 1:	(java compiler)
	java -> byte code		(instead of machine language)
	this byte code is an intermediate one

Stage 2:	(jre JIT compiler)		Just In Time
at run time, 
	byte code -> machine language code (this happens in the machine where we run)
	and execute the code.


Java language is same for 
	Linux
	Windows
	MacOS

write once
run in devices which has any of these OS and irrespective of 16 or 32 or 64 bit?
	at runtime only, it will compile to machine language and run there itself.

JDK vs JRE
----------------
	JDK	=	Java Development Kit
	JRE	=	Java Runtime Environment

JDK
	is for programmer
	to compile java code
	also has JRE

JRE
	is for running the compiled java class


JRE is used to run. Cannot compile.
JDK has both java.exe and javac.exe

javac is for compilation

What is a Java Virtual Machine?
	as the name suggests, it is virtual machine. Not physically found in folders.
	JVM is a process.		What is a process? in Task manager, you can see the processes running in a computer.
	JVM process
		has lot threads
			class loaders
			garbage collector

JDK, JVM, JRE

If i need to install Java in our computer?
	JDK or JRE?
	We will install JDK in our system. Because, we need compiler also.

Step1:
	search for "download java 17" in google.
	choose oracle official website from the search list
	choose 17 version of java
	download installer

	once download is completed,
	copy/ move the file to "softwares" folder

	double click the installer and follow the steps.

Step 2:
	create the necessary environment variables:
	1) in start menu, type environment variables
		system env var
		your account env var
			better choose your account env var

	2) create an env var
		JAVA_HOME
		C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17

	3) in "Path" env var
		append the following
			%JAVA_HOME%\bin

Step 3:
	cmd
		java -version

java version "17.0.10" 2024-01-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.10+11-LTS-240)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.10+11-LTS-240, mixed mode, sharing)

-----------------------------------------------
Learning to write a java code in a text editor
and then compile and execute in cmd prompt
is something we need to do now.

Later, we will move to using IDE like
	Eclipse
	Spring Tool Suite

---------------------------
Create a folder for this training purpose
in your system.
inside "training" folder
create a "java" folder
	Lets create all our java codes inside this folder.

Lets create our first java program:
	1) start menu, type "Notepad"
	2) save the file as
		"App.java"


in java, we cannot run a program without a class

public class App
{
	public static void main(String []args)
	{
		System.out.println("Hello world");
	}
}


go to cmd prompt where App.java is present

compile:
	javac App.java
run:
	java App


Task:
Write a java program using notepad
Save and use cmd prompt to compile
and execute the program
check the output.

Demo:
Accept a command line argument and display

public class App
{
	public static void main(String []args)
	{		
		System.out.println("Hello "+args[0]);
	}
}

Task:
Accept n number of command line arguments, separated by space.
Display all the command line arguments using any loop.

Hint:
	every array has length property
		args.length will give you, the number of arguments provided by the user.


public class App
{
	public static void main(String []args)
	{		
		System.out.print("Hello ");
		for(String arg : args)
		{
			System.out.print(arg+" ");
		}
	}
}
-----------------------------------------------
The java class name must be starting with capital letter
hence the file name also same.
----------------------------------------------
Configuring IDEs (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)

I recommend 
	Eclipse (or) STS	Spring Tool Suite


for core java (Java SE) we just need
	Eclipse for Java developer

but for you to continue learning advanced java (Java EE)
	you can download
		Eclipse for Java EE developer

Download Links
Windows 32-bit | x86_64

choose x86_64

if you download Spring Tool Suite
then it will allow you to create "Spring boot" projects from File menu itself.

there are 2 types of downloads in eclipse/sts

one is installer.
	that you download and install
another is package.
	that you download and unzip.
	once unzip, you got a folder
		that folder contains	eclipse or sts exe

eclipse ee package:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/2024-03/R/eclipse-jee-2024-03-R-win32-x86_64.zip

sts:
https://spring.io/tools



When we run eclipse,
it asks us to choose the workspace.

Workspace is a folder
	where all our projects are created.

-----------------------------------
Lets create a new 
	Java Project in eclipse

File -> New -> Java Project
	untick "create module-info.java" file

	1) Project name
		12-apr-1
	2) Use default location
		it will choose "workspace" location
	now, the project folder is created inside our workspace

you can see the following folders inside the project folder:
	src
	bin

src folder contains all the source code files
bin folder contains all the class files

Lets create an App.java file
	right click project -> New -> Class
		name of the class "App"
	tick the checkbox for "public static void main"

	click Finish button

Now, we got the class.
	write necessary code


public class App {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello world");
	}

}


right click the code
	run as -> Java Application


Look at the output in "Console" window.

Window menu -> show view -> Console
--------------------------------------------------
Task:
Create a java project in eclipse
add some System.out.println inside the main method

run the code
check the output in console.

-----------------------------------------
Conventions used in Java	(guidelines)

class name:
	Follow PascalCase
		first letter of every word to be upper case.
		ex:
			Employee
			ContractEmployee
			ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	should be a noun
		a java class name must be a noun. It cannot be a verb
			
method name:
	Follow camelCase
		very first letter is in lower case. Every next word first letter is in upper case.
		ex:
			acceptDetails
			calculateSimpleInterest

	should be a combination of verb and noun
			doThis	format
	
variables / object names:
		almost same as method convention but does not follow 	verb+noun at all
	
		ContractEmployee rajaSivaKumar;		the first letter is small.
		RetailCustomer sureshPeter;
		StringBuilder stringBuilder;
		Employee employee;

		employee.something();			employee is class or object?? ans: Object
							because, "e" is small

		variables must be noun.
		but index variables used in for loops can be shorter like 	i,j,k,etc
		otherwise, it must be meaningful.

constants:
		must be in full capitals.
		ex:
			final int TOTAL=100;
			final float AVERAGE_SCORE=12.2f;


		in C, C++ const is used. in Java, final is used.


operators:
		full small letters.
		ex:
			new
			instanceof
