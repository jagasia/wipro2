Arrays in Java
------------------
What is an array?
	Group of data, single (data) type
	Sequential manner
	Collection of similar data elements
	Array is a collection of homogeneous data structure allocating  memory consecutively

Question:
	Can we store different type of data in an array?
		I said Yes (!!!!!!). 
Question:
	How?
		I said, if we declare an array of "Object" type, then we can store any type of data in that array.
		
		Object []arr=new Object[10];
		arr[0]="Raja";
		arr[1]=20;		//auto boxed to Integer type
		arr[2]=1.2f;
		arr[3]=1.2;
		arr[4]=new Date();
		
	Observation:
		DOES THIS PROVE THAT WE CAN STORE ANY TYPE OF DATA IN AN ARRAY?
		NO......
		We are actually storing only 1 type here.................	Object type.

		automatically cast to Object type, because, Object is the super class for any class.

Many people wrongly assume that Collections are heterogenous. NO.	They are also homogeneous.
Unfair comparison happened between Collections and Arrays.

	ArrayList al=new ArrayList();
	al.add("Raja");
	al.add(new Integer(20));
	al.add(new Float(1.2f));
	
If array list can be object type, then 
array also can be object type.

So any collection / array in any language is Homegenous only.
Hetergenous structures
	c language 	Structure
cannot be considered as collection
and cannot be compared with arrays.

Arrays vs Collections
----------------------------
Arrays can be primitive types or reference types.
Collections can be reference types only. Wrappers are allowed instead of primitives

int arr[]=new int[10];		//this is a primitive type array.


Why collections cannot be primitive?
	Because each node, should contain, not only the value, but also reference to next node.
	a primitive can contain only value. 

Multiple variables with same name (but different index).

I want to store 20 country names in a variable.
countries[20]

Arrays have advantages:
	Direct access to any element using their index.
	Multiple values using same array name.
	Searching, sorting can be done on arrays when compared to individual variables.
	
India
Australia
Sri lanka
Japan
China
	countries is the name of the array.
	instead of having 5 variables, i have only 1 variable name

countries[0]	refers to India

	
Arrays have disadvantages:
	Consecutive memory location is required.
	Insertion and Deletion requires shifting adjacent elements.
	Array is fixed in size.	Deletion does not mean, memory becomes free.
	Array size cannot be changed, once created.

If you have 5 variables instead of an array of 5 elements,
we cannot use loop to access these elements.

If you are good in arrays in C, C++,
then you need to re-learn arrays again in java.
Syntax is itself different.

int C, C++:
	int arr[10];			//[] are always in right side of array name DURING DECLARATION

in C#:
	int []arr;			//[] are always in left side of array name DURING DECLARATION
in Java:
	int arr[]=new int[10];		
	int []arr=new int[10];
				//[] can be left or right side of array name



int arr[];		//declaration.	we do declaration to decide the scope of the variable.
arr=new int[10];	//heap memory is allocated. Actually an array is created now only. Its reference is stored in the stack variable arr.


in java, you can create array of variable length.

int n=100;
int arr[n];		//is it possible in C language?

in Java, we can do that.

int n=100;			//you can get input from the user and then create an array of that size
int arr[]=new int[n];


Arrays can be of any number of dimension in java.
single dimensional array
	int arr[]=new int[n];
multiple dimensions in java array, can be Jagged.

what is jagged array?
	Jagged means uneven.
	
if you consider a 2 dimensional array as 
	rows and columns

each row can have different length of columns in the array.

int arr[][]=new int[10][10];		//evenly created array. 		10 rows * 10 columns

int arr[][]=new int[5][];
arr[0]=new int[10];			//1st row has 10 columns
arr[1]=new int[8];			//2nd row has 8 columns
arr[2]=new int[12];			//3rd row has 12 columns


Task:
import java.util.Arrays;

public class App5 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int arr[][]= {
				{1,2,3},
				{11,22,33,44,55},
				{100,200},
				{1000,2000,3000,4000}
		};
		
//		System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(arr));
		//how do we loop this array?
		
	}
}


Write a for loop / nested for loop to display all the elements of this arr

Control Flow Statements (if, switch, loops - for, while, do-while)

1) for loop
2) for each loop	/ 	enchanced for loop		(jdk 1.5 onwards)
	works with arrays and collections

while loop
	while(condition)
	{
		//code that should repeat
	}

if you do not use {} then first line after while will be part of while loop

	while(true);		//a semi column makes the while loop does not have a body

do while
	executes at least once and then checks the condition at the bottom of the loop.
	suitable where we need to check whether to repeat or not.
---------------------------
How to access each digit of a number?
1) using modulo 10 and div by 10
if you module a number by 10, you get last digit.
123%10		returns 3
123/10		returns 12

another approach:
i convert this number into String
i can access every character of a String using		charAt(index)
for(int i=0;i<str.length;i++)
{
	char c=str.charAt(i)		//gives me 1 character at a time. 	Each char can be converted into int		
	//if you cast char to int, you will get ascii value.	-48	will give you the number. Why?		ascii of 0 is 48

  Open Declaration   int[] java.util.Arrays.copyOfRange(int[] original, int from, int to)


Copies the specified range of the specified array into a new array.The initial index of the range (from) must lie between zeroand original.length, inclusive. The value at original[from] is placed into the initial element of the copy(unless from == original.length or from == to).Values from subsequent elements in the original array are placed intosubsequent elements in the copy. The final index of the range(to), which must be greater than or equal to from,may be greater than original.length, in which case 0 is placed in all elements of the copy whose index isgreater than or equal to original.length - from. The lengthof the returned array will be to - from.
Parameters:original the array from which a range is to be copiedfrom the initial index of the range to be copied, inclusiveto the final index of the range to be copied, exclusive.(This index may lie outside the array.)Returns:a new array containing the specified range from the original array,truncated or padded with zeros to obtain the required lengthThrows:ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - if from < 0or from > original.lengthIllegalArgumentException - if from > toNullPointerException - if original is nullSince:1.6
